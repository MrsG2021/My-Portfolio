            <h2 class="mt-2">
              Front-End Developer, from South Africa, based in Ireland
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              A little insight into who I am. I was born and raised in South
              Africa and stayed there until I moved to Ireland with my Husband
              and our two Beagirls for better work opportunities in 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have always worked but never really found anything I could call
              my passion. So while on the hunt for something that feeds into my
              creative value but still makes fair money, I came across SheCodes
              and started learning how to code. I enjoy coding for a number of
              reasons, I can design something from scratch and make it totally
              uniquie or exactly the same as something else, I find it mentally
              stimulating and challenging which also feed into my key values. I
              take great pride in any bit of work and will always give 100% of
              myself, being able to see a finished project and have it out on
              the internet forever is quite a thrill.
            </p>
            <p>
              I look forward to working with you to bring your ideas and dreams
              to life.
            </p>
